    "The Film is designed to be a sacrificial layer that takes all the beating & damage. It does not give you 100% guarantee that you will never get a paint damage. A big enough, sharp rock can still rip a hole in the film & damage the paint. But in most cases PPF will absorb the impact and leave your paint undamaged.",
